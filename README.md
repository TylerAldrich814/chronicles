# Chronicles - Online Tabletop RPG Platform

#### Just a personal project meant for solidifying my knowledge in Backend programing, GCP, and Go. What I plan for this personal project is to allow user's to seamlessly connect online. Where they'll  have the ability to play table top RPG games.





#### There are features that I would love to implement and will work towards doing so, while I have the free time.

- **Live Audio**: Seamless audio integration for real-time communication between all players.
- **Chatroom Messaging**: Engage in user-to-room and private user-to-user conversations.
- **Customizable RPG Rules**: Tailor your gameplay with customizable RPG rules parameters and saving these rules as presets.
